# Object-Detection-Project
2024-25 First year Brunel Computer Science Java project based around the SwiftBot hardware.
(Includes modifications made for the subsequent group project.)

The project was heavily interface-driven, which provided flexibility.

At the time, the codebase lacked proper testing, as I did not yet have the familiarity to integrate JUnit effectively into the development workflow. 
Since then, I have deepened my understanding of both JUnit and broader testing methodologies.
Through this growth, I have come to recognize that test-driven development (TDD) should be considered a top and crucial priority in modern software engineering.
Not only does it enhance reliability and maintainability, but it is also especially critical in contexts involving LLM-assisted coding, where comprehensive test coverage ensures code correctness, guards against regressions, and provides a robust foundation for iterative improvements.
